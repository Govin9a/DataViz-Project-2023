    "# Background\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Introduction\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF) is a critical medical condition that arises when the respiratory system fails to maintain adequate oxygenation and/or remove carbon dioxide from the blood. This condition poses a serious threat to individuals, requiring prompt diagnosis and intervention. Understanding the significance of ARF is crucial in the medical field, as it is associated with various underlying causes and can have profound implications on patient outcomes.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Importance of Researching ARF\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. **Life-Threatening Nature:** ARF is a life-threatening condition that demands immediate medical attention. The severity of respiratory failure can vary, and timely diagnosis and intervention are essential to improve patient outcomes.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. **Diverse Underlying Causes:** ARF can result from a range of underlying conditions, including but not limited to severe pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and pulmonary embolism. Investigating ARF provides insights into the diverse etiological factors contributing to respiratory failure.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3. **Clinical Complexity:** The clinical complexity of ARF makes it a challenging condition to manage. The interplay of respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological factors requires a comprehensive understanding to tailor effective treatment strategies.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "4. **Public Health Impact:** Researching ARF contributes to our understanding of respiratory health on a broader scale. Insights gained from studying ARF can inform public health initiatives, clinical guidelines, and healthcare policies aimed at preventing, diagnosing, and managing respiratory conditions.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## The MIMIC-III Dataset\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In this study, we leverage the **Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III)** dataset to conduct our research. MIMIC-III is a freely accessible and widely used database that provides detailed clinical information on patients admitted to critical care units. The dataset includes a wealth of information, such as demographic details, clinical notes, laboratory results, and treatment records, making it a valuable resource for exploring and understanding complex medical conditions.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Key Features of MIMIC-III:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Scope:** MIMIC-III encompasses data from a diverse range of patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts.\r\n",
    "  \r\n",
    "- **Temporal Coverage:** The dataset spans over a decade, from 2001 to 2012, capturing a wide range of medical cases and allowing for longitudinal analyses.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Data Types:** MIMIC-III includes structured data (e.g., demographics, vital signs, laboratory results) as well as unstructured data (e.g., clinical notes, imaging reports), providing a comprehensive view of patients' medical journeys.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Purpose of this Notebook\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The primary objective of this Jupyter Notebook is to visually explore and potentially investigate the pattARFcute Respiratory Failure (ARF) and other diagnoses The MIMIC-III dataset is large; the aspects of the data we chose to focus on includes both common lab measurements and clinical notes, with some basic patient information. within the MIMIC-III dataset. By leveraging data visualization techniques, we aim to gain insights into the prevalence, characteristics, and outcomes aon to other diagnoses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Questions\n",
    "* Is there any noticeable difference in some of the most common lab measurements between ARF diagnoses and other diagnoses?\n",
    "* Are there common trends between lab measurements and clinical notes for a diagnosis?\n",
